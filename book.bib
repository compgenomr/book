  abstract = "MOTIVATION: DNA methylation plays critical roles in gene
              regulation and cellular specification without altering DNA
              sequences. The wide application of reduced representation
              bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing
              (bis-seq) opens the door to study DNA methylation at single CpG
              site resolution. One challenging question is how best to test for
              significant methylation differences between groups of biological
              samples in order to minimize false positive findings. RESULTS: We
              present a statistical analysis package, methylSig, to analyse
              genome-wide methylation differences between samples from
              different treatments or disease groups. MethylSig takes into
              account both read coverage and biological variation by utilizing
              a beta-binomial approach across biological samples for a CpG site
              or region, and identifies relevant differences in CpG
              methylation. It can also incorporate local information to improve
              group methylation level and/or variance estimation for
              experiments with small sample size. A permutation study based on
              data from enhanced RRBS samples shows that methylSig maintains a
              well-calibrated type-I error when the number of samples is three
              or more per group. Our simulations show that methylSig has higher
              sensitivity compared with several alternative methods. The use of
              methylSig is illustrated with a comparison of different subtypes
              of acute leukemia and normal bone marrow samples. AVAILABILITY:
              methylSig is available as an R package at

              mammalian development, but their precise functions are only
              partially understood. To investigate epigenetic regulation of
              embryonic development, we differentiated human embryonic stem
              cells into mesendoderm, neural progenitor cells, trophoblast-like
              cells, and mesenchymal stem cells and systematically
              characterized DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and the

              active in early developmental stages tend to be CG rich and
              mainly engage H3K27me3 upon silencing in nonexpressing lineages.
              By contrast, promoters for genes expressed preferentially at
              later stages are often CG poor and primarily employ DNA
              methylation upon repression. Interestingly, the early
              developmental regulatory genes are often located in large genomic
              domains that are generally devoid of DNA methylation in most
              lineages, which we termed DNA methylation valleys (DMVs). Our

              with large-scale mass spectrometry analysis of

              large numbers of interesting TF-TF associations. We observe

              exposed to different conditions and across multiple cell types.

              method to primary human bone marrow specimens from patients with
              Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia (AML), we demonstrated that

  abstract = "Analysis of bisulfite sequencing data usually requires two tasks:
              to call methylated cytosines (mCs) in a sample, and to detect
              differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between paired samples.
              Although numerous tools have been proposed for mC calling,
              methods for DMR detection have been largely limited. Here, we
              present Bisulfighter, a new software package for detecting mCs
              and DMRs from bisulfite sequencing data. Bisulfighter combines
              the LAST alignment tool for mC calling, and a novel framework for
              DMR detection based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike
              previous attempts that depend on empirical parameters,
              Bisulfighter can use the expectation-maximization algorithm for
              HMMs to adjust parameters for each data set. We conduct extensive
              experiments in which accuracy of mC calling and DMR detection is

              qualities, sequencing depths and DMR lengths, as well as on real

              fewer false positives, more precise estimates of mC levels, more

              and chromatin architecture, are now acknowledged as a universal
              feature of tumorigenesis. Medulloblastoma, a clinically
              challenging, malignant childhood brain tumour, is no exception.
              Despite much progress from recent genomics studies, with
              recurrent changes identified in each of the four distinct tumour
              subgroups (WNT-pathway-activated, SHH-pathway-activated, and the
              less-well-characterized Group 3 and Group 4), many cases still
              lack an obvious genetic driver. Here we present whole-genome
              bisulphite-sequencing data from thirty-four human and five murine
              tumours plus eight human and three murine normal controls,
              augmented with matched whole-genome, RNA and chromatin
              immunoprecipitation sequencing data. This comprehensive data set
              allowed us to decipher several features underlying the interplay
              between the genome, epigenome and transcriptome, and its effects
              on medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Most notable were highly
              prevalent regions of hypomethylation correlating with increased
              gene expression, extending tens of kilobases downstream of
              transcription start sites. Focal regions of low methylation
              linked to transcription-factor-binding sites shed light on
              differential transcriptional networks between subgroups, whereas
              increased methylation due to re-normalization of repressed
              chromatin in DNA methylation valleys was positively correlated
              with gene expression. Large, partially methylated domains
              affecting up to one-third of the genome showed increased mutation
              rates and gene silencing in a subgroup-specific fashion.
              Epigenetic alterations also affected novel medulloblastoma
              candidate genes (for example, LIN28B), resulting in alternative
              promoter usage and/or differential messenger RNA/microRNA
              expression. Analysis of mouse medulloblastoma and precursor-cell
              methylation demonstrated a somatic origin for many alterations.
              Our data provide insights into the epigenetic regulation of
              transcription and genome organization in medulloblastoma

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by
              high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome
              tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip) have become standard
              technologies for genome-wide identification of DNA-binding
              protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been developed
              in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from
              ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in
              the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as
              custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks can
              be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of
              binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across
              the genome. RESULTS: We have developed ChIPpeakAnno as a
              Bioconductor package within the statistical programming
              environment R to facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks
              identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene
              expression (CAGE) or any experiments resulting in a large number
              of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites annotated with
              ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or
              plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to
              the nearest genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have
              implemented functionalities for determining the significance of
              overlap between replicates or binding sites among transcription
              factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn diagrams to
              visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
              Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve
              sequences flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification,
              cloning, or motif discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO)
              terms associated with adjacent genes. CONCLUSIONS: ChIPpeakAnno
              enables batch annotation of the binding sites identified from
              ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a
              large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical
              programming environment R. Allowing users to pass their own
              annotation data such as a different Chromatin immunoprecipitation

              annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and BSgenome,

  abstract = "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that has
              essential roles in cellular processes including gene regulation,
              development and disease and is widely dysregulated in most types
              of cancer. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled
              the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide
              resolution through methods such as whole-genome bisulfite
              sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In
              DNA methylation studies, a key task is to identify differences
              under distinct biological contexts, for example, between tumor
              and normal tissue. A challenge in sequencing studies is that the
              number of biological replicates is often limited by the costs of
              sequencing. The small number of replicates leads to unstable
              variance estimation, which can reduce accuracy to detect
              differentially methylated loci (DML). Here we propose a novel
              statistical method to detect DML when comparing two treatment
              groups. The sequencing counts are described by a
              lognormal-beta-binomial hierarchical model, which provides a
              basis for information sharing across different CpG sites. A Wald
              test is developed for hypothesis testing at each CpG site.
              Simulation results show that the proposed method yields improved
              DML detection compared to existing methods, particularly when the
              number of replicates is low. The proposed method is implemented

              array of biological processes. Bisulfite conversion of DNA
              followed by high-throughput sequencing is increasingly being used
              to assess genome-wide methylation at single-base resolution. The
              relative slowness of most commonly used aligners for processing
              such data introduces an unnecessarily long delay between receipt
              of raw data and statistical analysis. While this process can be
              sped-up by using computer clusters, current tools are not
              designed with them in mind and end-users must create such
              implementations themselves. RESULTS: Here, we present a novel
              BS-seq aligner, Bison, which exploits multiple nodes of a
              computer cluster to speed up this process and also has increased
              accuracy. Bison is accompanied by a variety of helper programs
              and scripts to ease, as much as possible, the process of quality
              control and preparing results for statistical analysis by a
              variety of popular R packages. Bison is also accompanied by
              bison\_herd, a variant of Bison with the same output but that can
              scale to a semi-arbitrary number of nodes, with concomitant
              increased demands on the underlying message passing interface
              implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Bison is a new bisulfite-converted
              short-read aligner providing end users easier scalability for
              performance gains, more accurate alignments, and a convenient
              pathway for quality controlling alignments and converting
              methylation calls into a form appropriate for statistical

              The whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technique measures
              the methylation level at each cytosine throughout the genome.
              There are an increasing number of publicly available pipelines
              for analyzing WGBS data, reflecting many choices of read mapping
              algorithms as well as preprocessing and postprocessing methods.
              We simulated single-end and paired-end reads based on three
              experimental data sets, and comprehensively evaluated 192
              combinations of three preprocessing, five postprocessing and five
              widely used read mapping algorithms. We also compared paired-end
              data with single-end data at the same sequencing depth for
              performance of read mapping and methylation level estimation.
              Bismark and LAST were the most robust mapping algorithms. We
              found that Mott trimming and quality filtering individually

              level estimation, but combining them did not lead to further

  abstract = "Bisulfite genomic sequencing is the method of choice for the
              generation of methylation maps with single-base resolution. The
              method is based on the selective deamination of cytosine to
              uracil by treatment with bisulfite and the sequencing of
              subsequently generated PCR products. In contrast to cytosine,
              5-methylcytosine does not react with bisulfite and can therefore
              be distinguished. In order to investigate the potential for
              optimization of the method and to determine the critical
              experimental parameters, we determined the influence of
              incubation time and incubation temperature on the deamination
              efficiency and measured the degree of DNA degradation during the
              bisulfite treatment. We found that maximum conversion rates of
              cytosine occurred at 55 degrees C (4-18 h) and 95 degrees C (1
              h). Under these conditions at least 84-96\% of the DNA is
              degraded. To study the impact of primer selection, homologous DNA

               Although prior experience of a stimulus can produce a feeling of
               familiarity, that feeling can also be aroused in the absence of
               prior experience if perceptual processing of the stimulus is
               fluent (e.g., B. W. Whittlesea et al, 1990). This suggests that
               feelings of familiarity arise through an unconscious inference
               about the source of processing fluency. The present experiments
               extend that conclusion. First, they show that a wide variety of
               feelings about the past are controlled by a fluency heuristic,
               including feelings about the meaning, pleasantness, duration,
               and recency of past events. Second, they demonstrate that the
               attribution process does not rely only on perceptual fluency,
               but can be influenced even more by the fluency of conceptual
               processing. Third, they show that although the fluency heuristic
               itself is simple, people's use of it is highly sophisticated and
               makes them robustly sensitive to the actual historical status of

  abstract = "Most of the studies characterizing DNA methylation patterns have
              been restricted to particular genomic loci in a limited number of
              human samples and pathological conditions. Herein, we present a
              compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human
              sample population with an intermediate level of resolution of
              CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained a DNA methylation
              fingerprint of 1628 human samples in which we interrogated 1505
              CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this
              epigenetic mark to be critical in tissue-type definition and
              stemness, particularly around transcription start sites that are
              not within a CpG island. For disease, the generated DNA
              methylation fingerprints show that, during tumorigenesis, human
              cancer cells underwent a progressive gain of promoter CpG-island
              hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in non-CpG-island
              promoters. Although transformed cells are those in which DNA
              methylation disruption is more obvious, we observed that other
              common human diseases, such as neurological and autoimmune
              disorders, had their own distinct DNA methylation profiles. Most
              importantly, we provide proof of principle that the DNA
              methylation fingerprints obtained might be useful for
              translational purposes by showing that we are able to identify
              the tumor type origin of cancers of unknown primary origin
              (CUPs). Thus, the DNA methylation patterns identified across the

              diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short reads to a
              reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five
              bisulfite short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker,
              BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing two classes of mapping algorithms

              efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to
              the genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing
              default parameter settings using both real and simulated reads.
              We also investigated how preprocessing data might affect mapping
              efficiency. Conclusion. Among the five programs compared, in
              terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the
              real data, followed by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and

              mapping efficiency. Although increasing the number of mismatches
              allowed can increase mapping efficiency, it not only
              significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk of
              having increased false positives. Therefore, users should

              discovered in a variety of cell lines and tissues, do not fit
              this paradigm as they show partial methylation for large portions
              (20\%-40\%) of the genome. While in PMDs methylation levels are
              reduced on average, we found that at single CpG resolution, they
              show extensive variability along the genome outside of CpG
              islands and DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS). Methylation
              levels range from 0\% to 100\% in a roughly uniform fashion with
              only little similarity between neighboring CpGs. A comparison of
              various PMD-containing methylomes showed that these seemingly
              disordered states of methylation are strongly conserved across
              cell types for virtually every PMD. Comparative sequence analysis
              suggests that DNA sequence is a major determinant of these

              sequence based model which can predict 31\% (R(2)) of the
              variation in methylation. The model revealed CpG density as the
              main driving feature promoting methylation, opposite to what has
              been shown for CpG islands, followed by various dinucleotides
              immediately flanking the CpG and a minor contribution from
              sequence preferences reflecting nucleosome positioning. Taken

              nucleotide-specific methylation levels observed in PMDs,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing currently provides
              the highest-precision view of the epigenome, with quantitative
              information about populations of cells down to single nucleotide
              resolution. Several studies have demonstrated the value of this
              precision: meaningful features that correlate strongly with
              biological functions can be found associated with only a few CpG
              sites. Understanding the role of DNA methylation, and more
              broadly the role of DNA accessibility, requires that methylation
              differences between populations of cells are identified with
              extreme precision and in complex experimental designs. RESULTS:
              In this work we investigated the use of beta-binomial regression
              as a general approach for modeling whole-genome bisulfite data to
              identify differentially methylated sites and genomic intervals.
              CONCLUSIONS: The regression-based analysis can handle medium- and
              large-scale experiments where it becomes critical to accurately
              model variation in methylation levels between replicates and
              account for influence of various experimental factors like cell
              types or batch effects.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bisulfite sequencing is a powerful technique to study
              DNA cytosine methylation. Bisulfite treatment followed by PCR
              amplification specifically converts unmethylated cytosines to
              thymine. Coupled with next generation sequencing technology, it
              is able to detect the methylation status of every cytosine in the
              genome. However, mapping high-throughput bisulfite reads to the
              reference genome remains a great challenge due to the increased
              searching space, reduced complexity of bisulfite sequence,
              asymmetric cytosine to thymine alignments, and multiple CpG
              heterogeneous methylation. RESULTS: We developed an efficient
              bisulfite reads mapping algorithm BSMAP to address the above
              issues. BSMAP combines genome hashing and bitwise masking to
              achieve fast and accurate bisulfite mapping. Compared with
              existing bisulfite mapping approaches, BSMAP is faster, more
              sensitive and more flexible. CONCLUSION: BSMAP is the first
              general-purpose bisulfite mapping software. It is able to map
              high-throughput bisulfite reads at whole genome level with

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We recently showed that enzymes of the TET family
              convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA. 5-hmC is
              present at high levels in embryonic stem cells and Purkinje
              neurons. The methylation status of cytosines is typically
              assessed by reaction with sodium bisulfite followed by PCR
              amplification. Reaction with sodium bisulfite promotes cytosine
              deamination, whereas 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) reacts poorly with
              bisulfite and is resistant to deamination. Since 5-hmC reacts
              with bisulfite to yield cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS), we
              asked how DNA containing 5-hmC behaves in bisulfite sequencing.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used synthetic
              oligonucleotides with different distributions of cytosine as
              templates for generation of DNAs containing C, 5-mC and 5-hmC.
              The resulting DNAs were subjected in parallel to bisulfite
              treatment, followed by exposure to conditions promoting cytosine
              deamination. The extent of conversion of 5-hmC to CMS was
              estimated to be 99.7\%. Sequencing of PCR products showed that
              neither 5-mC nor 5-hmC undergo C-to-T transitions after bisulfite
              treatment, confirming that these two modified cytosine species
              are indistinguishable by the bisulfite technique. DNA in which
              CMS constituted a large fraction of all bases (28/201) was much
              less efficiently amplified than DNA in which those bases were
              5-mC or uracil (the latter produced by cytosine deamination).
              Using a series of primer extension experiments, we traced the
              inefficient amplification of CMS-containing DNA to stalling of
              Taq polymerase at sites of CMS modification, especially when two
              CMS bases were either adjacent to one another or separated by 1-2
              nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the widely used
              bisulfite sequencing technique does not distinguish between 5-mC
              and 5-hmC. Moreover, we show that CMS, the product of bisulfite
              conversion of 5-hmC, tends to stall DNA polymerases during PCR,
              suggesting that densely hydroxymethylated regions of DNA may be
              underrepresented in quantitative methylation analyses.",

              Here we show that our bimodal distribution model and weighted
              cost function for optimized regional methylation analysis
              provides accurate boundaries of regions harboring significant

              directionality of DMRs and their genome-wide distribution, and we

              epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular

              data and generating DNA methylomes. BS-Seeker2 improves
              mappability over existing aligners by using local alignment. It
              can also map reads from RRBS library by building special indexes
              with improved efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, BS-Seeker2
              provides additional function for filtering out reads with
              incomplete bisulfite conversion, which is useful in minimizing
              the overestimation of DNA methylation levels. We also defined
              CGmap and ATCGmap file formats for full representations of DNA
              methylomes, as part of the outputs of BS-Seeker2 pipeline
              together with BAM and WIG files. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluations on
              the performance show that BS-Seeker2 works efficiently and
              accurately for both WGBS data and RRBS data. BS-Seeker2 is freely
              available at http://pellegrini.mcdb.ucla.edu/BS\_Seeker2/ and the

              acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia
              (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
              A total of 294,631 sequences was generated with an average read

              Comprehensive analysis of CpG methylation patterns at a single

              Illumina (Illumina HM450K) are among the most popular CpG
              microarray platforms widely used in biological and medical
              research. Several recent studies highlighted the potentially
              confounding impact of the genomic variation on the results of
              methylation studies performed using Illumina's Infinium
              methylation probes. However, the complexity of SNPs impact on the
              methylation level measurements ($\beta$ values) has not been
              comprehensively described. RESULTS: In our comparative study of
              European and Asian populations performed using Illumina HM450K,
              we found that the majority of Infinium probes, which
              differentiated two examined groups, had SNPs in their target
              sequence. Characteristic tri-modal or bi-modal patterns of
              $\beta$ values distribution among individual samples were
              observed for CpGs with SNPs in the first and second position,
              respectively. To better understand how SNPs affect methylation
              readouts, we investigated their impact in the context of SNP
              position and type, and of the Illumina probe type (Infinium I or
              II). CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that SNP
              variation existing in the genome, if not accounted for, may lead
              to false interpretation of the methylation signal differences
              suggested by some of the Illumina Infinium probes. In addition,
              it provides important practical clues for discriminating between
              differences due to the methylation status and to the genomic
              polymorphisms, based on the inspection of methylation readouts in
              individual samples. This approach is of special importance when

              of coverage along chromosomes. Technological or genomic
              variations in the depth of coverage thus lead to a high false
              discovery rate (FDR), even upon correction for GC content. In the
              context of association studies between CNVs and disease, a high
              FDR means many false CNVs, thereby decreasing the discovery power
              of the study after correction for multiple testing. We propose
              'Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS' (cn.MOPS), a
              data processing pipeline for CNV detection in NGS data. In
              contrast to previous approaches, cn.MOPS incorporates modeling of
              depths of coverage across samples at each genomic position.
              Therefore, cn.MOPS is not affected by read count variations along
              chromosomes. Using a Bayesian approach, cn.MOPS decomposes
              variations in the depth of coverage across samples into integer
              copy numbers and noise by means of its mixture components and
              Poisson distributions, respectively. The noise estimate allows
              for reducing the FDR by filtering out detections having high
              noise that are likely to be false detections. We compared cn.MOPS
              with the five most popular methods for CNV detection in NGS data

              10-fold coverage at single-CpG resolution based on a
              Beta-Binomial hierarchical model and is capable of processing two
              billion reads in 24 CPU hours. Here, using simulated and real

              leaves 5-methylcytosines unchanged. Two types of

              5-methylcytosine to thymine, and failure to convert unmethylated

              hours of exposure to low-molarity, low-temperature bisulfite

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Detection of differential methylation between
              biological samples is an important task in bisulfite-seq data
              analysis. Several studies have attempted de novo finding of
              differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using hidden Markov
              models (HMMs). However, there is room for improvement in the
              design of HMMs, especially on emission functions that evaluate
              the likelihood of differential methylation at each cytosine site.
              RESULTS: We describe a new HMM for DMR detection from
              bisulfite-seq data. Our method utilizes emission functions that
              combine binomial models for aligned read counts, and beta
              mixtures for incorporating genome-wide methylation level
              distributions. We also develop unsupervised learning algorithms
              to adjust parameters of the beta-binomial models depending on
              differential methylation types (up, down, and not changed). In
              experiments on both simulated and real datasets, the new HMM
              improves DMR detection accuracy compared with HMMs in our
              previous study. Furthermore, our method achieves better accuracy

              The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG
              sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed
              non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the
              exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated
              to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the
              basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances
              outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on
              the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with
              fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly
              hyper-methylated, while larger clusters are predominantly
              hypo-methylated. Intermediate clusters, however, are either

              methylation enzymes that can act on CpGs over an extended local
              region, while unmethylated CpGs recruit demethylation enzymes
              that act more strongly on nearby CpGs. This model can reproduce

              issue, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of
              newborn and centenarian genomes. The centenarian DNA had a lower
              DNA methylation content and a reduced correlation in the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite the important role DNA methylation plays in
              transcriptional regulation, the transgenerational inheritance of
              DNA methylation is not well understood. The genetic heritability
              of DNA methylation has been estimated using twin pairs, although
              concern has been expressed whether the underlying assumption of
              equal common environmental effects are applicable due to
              intrauterine differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.
              We estimate the heritability of DNA methylation on peripheral
              blood leukocytes using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array using a
              family based sample of 614 people from 117 families, allowing
              comparison both within and across generations. RESULTS: The
              correlations from the various available relative pairs indicate
              that on average the similarity in DNA methylation between
              relatives is predominantly due to genetic effects with any common
              environmental or zygotic effects being limited. The average
              heritability of DNA methylation measured at probes with no known
              SNPs is estimated as 0.187. The ten most heritable methylation
              probes were investigated with a genome-wide association study,
              all showing highly statistically significant cis mQTLs. Further
              investigation of one of these cis mQTL, found in the MHC region
              of chromosome 6, showed the most significantly associated SNP was
              also associated with over 200 other DNA methylation probes in
              this region and the gene expression level of 9 genes.
              CONCLUSIONS: The majority of transgenerational similarity in DNA
              methylation is attributable to genetic effects, and approximately
              20\% of individual differences in DNA methylation in the
              population are caused by DNA sequence variation that is not
              located within CpG sites.",

To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.},

Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

	abstract = {Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized how research is carried out in many areas of biology and medicine. However, the analysis of NGS data remains a major obstacle to the efficient utilization of the technology, as it requires complex multi-step processing of big data demanding considerable computational expertise from users. While substantial effort has been invested on the development of software dedicated to the individual analysis steps of NGS experiments, insufficient resources are currently available for integrating the individual software components within the widely used R/Bioconductor environment into automated workflows capable of running the analysis of most types of NGS applications from start-to-finish in a time-efficient and reproducible manner.
Results: To address this need, we have developed the R/Bioconductor package systemPipeR. It is an extensible environment for both building and running end-to-end analysis workflows with automated report generation for a wide range of NGS applications. Its unique features include a uniform workflow interface across different NGS applications, automated report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software on local computers and computer clusters. A flexible sample annotation infrastructure efficiently handles complex sample sets and experimental designs. To simplify the analysis of widely used NGS applications, the package provides pre-configured workflows and reporting templates for RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Additional workflow templates will be provided in the future.
Conclusions: systemPipeR accelerates the extraction of reproducible analysis results from NGS experiments. By combining the capabilities of many R/Bioconductor and command-line tools, it makes efficient use of existing software resources without limiting the user to a set of predefined methods or environments. systemPipeR is freely available for all common operating systems from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/systemPipeR).},

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the assay of choice for high-throughput studies of gene expression. However, as is the case with microarrays, major technology-related artifacts and biases affect the resulting expression measures. Normalization is therefore essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels and subsequent analyses thereof.
RESULTS: We focus on biases related to GC-content and demonstrate the existence of strong sample-specific GC-content effects on RNA-Seq read counts, which can substantially bias differential expression analysis. We propose three simple within-lane gene-level GC-content normalization approaches and assess their performance on two different RNA-Seq datasets, involving different species and experimental designs. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art normalization procedures in terms of bias and mean squared error for expression fold-change estimation and in terms of Type I error and p-value distributions for tests of differential expression. The exploratory data analysis and normalization methods proposed in this article are implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R package EDASeq.
CONCLUSIONS: Our within-lane normalization procedures, followed by between-lane normalization, reduce GC-content bias and lead to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression. Such results are crucial for the biological interpretation of RNA-Seq experiments, where downstream analyses can be sensitive to the supplied lists of genes.},

STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/., Contact:

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 220 concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification.

	abstract = {Background: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs.
Results: To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred. GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, GAGE derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6 study, GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways–all of which are supported by the experimental literature.
Conclusion: GAGE is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most frequently used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented in R in the "gage" package, available under the GNU GPL from http:// sysbio.engin.umich.edu/{\textasciitilde}luow/downloads.php.},

	abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

	abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS—the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases—make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

The web server allows the user to impose constraints on the predicted gene structure. A constraint can specify the position of a splice site, a translation initiation site or a stop codon. Furthermore, it is possible to specify the position of known exons and intervals that are known to be exonic or intronic sequence. The number of constraints is arbitrary and constraints can be combined in order to pin down larger parts of the predicted gene structure. The result then is the most likely gene structure that complies with all given user constraints, if such a gene structure exists. The specification of constraints is useful when part of the gene structure is known, e.g. by expressed sequence tag or protein sequence alignments, or if the user wants to change the default prediction. The web interface and the downloadable stand-alone program are available free of charge at .},

	abstract = {Gene fusions created by somatic genomic rearrangements are known to play an important role in the onset and development of some cancers, such as lymphomas and sarcomas. RNA-Seq (whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing) is proving to be a useful tool for the discovery of novel gene fusions in cancer transcriptomes. However, algorithmic methods for the discovery of gene fusions using RNA-Seq data remain underdeveloped. We have developed deFuse, a novel computational method for fusion discovery in tumor RNA-Seq data. Unlike existing methods that use only unique best-hit alignments and consider only fusion boundaries at the ends of known exons, deFuse considers all alignments and all possible locations for fusion boundaries. As a result, deFuse is able to identify fusion sequences with demonstrably better sensitivity than previous approaches. To increase the specificity of our approach, we curated a list of 60 true positive and 61 true negative fusion sequences (as confirmed by RT-PCR), and have trained an adaboost classifier on 11 novel features of the sequence data. The resulting classifier has an estimated value of 0.91 for the area under the ROC curve. We have used deFuse to discover gene fusions in 40 ovarian tumor samples, one ovarian cancer cell line, and three sarcoma samples. We report herein the first gene fusions discovered in ovarian cancer. We conclude that gene fusions are not infrequent events in ovarian cancer and that these events have the potential to substantially alter the expression patterns of the genes involved; gene fusions should therefore be considered in efforts to comprehensively characterize the mutational profiles of ovarian cancer transcriptomes.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although {\textgreater}90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads.

There is a growing need to analyze experiments with biological replicates, especially for epigenomic experiments where variation among biological samples can be substantial. However, tools that can perform group comparisons are currently lacking. {RESULTS}: We present a peak-calling prioritization pipeline ({PePr}) for identifying consistent or differential binding sites in {ChIP}-Seq experiments with biological replicates. {PePr} models read counts across the genome among biological samples with a negative binomial distribution and uses a local variance estimation method, ranking consistent or differential binding sites more favorably than sites with greater variability. We compared {PePr} with commonly used and recently proposed approaches on eight {TF} datasets and show that {PePr} uniquely identifies consistent regions with enriched read counts, high motif occurrence rate and known characteristics of {TF} binding based on visual inspection. For histone modification data with broadly enriched regions, {PePr} identified differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperformed other methods in scaling False Discovery Rate ({FDR}) analysis. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: http://code.google.com/p/pepr-chip-seq/. \copyright The Author 2014.

A number of peak- and window-based strategies have been developed to detect differential binding when the regions of interest are not known in advance. However, careful consideration of error control is needed when applying these methods. Peak-based approaches use the same data set to define peaks and to detect differential binding. Done improperly, this can result in loss of type I error control. For window-based methods, controlling the false discovery rate over all detected windows does not guarantee control across all detected regions. Misinterpreting the former as the latter can result in unexpected liberalness. Here, several solutions are presented to maintain error control for these de novo counting strategies. For peak-based methods, peak calling should be performed on pooled libraries prior to the statistical analysis. For window-based methods, a hybrid approach using Simes' method is proposed to maintain control of the false discovery rate across regions. More generally, the relative advantages of peak- and window-based strategies are explored using a range of simulated and real data sets. Implementations of both strategies also compare favourably to existing programs for differential binding analyses. \copyright The Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Detection of changes in deoxyribonucleic acid ({DNA})-protein interactions from {ChIP}-seq data is a crucial step in unraveling the regulatory networks behind biological processes. The simplest variation of this problem is the differential peak calling ({DPC}) problem. Here, one has to find genomic regions with {ChIP}-seq signal changes between two cellular conditions in the interaction of a protein with {DNA}. The great majority of peak calling methods can only analyze one {ChIP}-seq signal at a time and are unable to perform {DPC}. Recently, a few approaches based on the combination of these peak callers with statistical tests for detecting differential digital expression have been proposed. However, these methods fail to detect detailed changes of protein-{DNA} interactions. {RESULTS}: We propose an One-stage {DIffereNtial} peak caller ({ODIN}); an Hidden Markov Model-based approach to detect and analyze differential peaks ({DPs}) in pairs of {ChIP}-seq data. {ODIN} performs genomic signal processing, peak calling and p-value calculation in an integrated framework. We also propose an evaluation methodology to compare {ODIN} with competing methods. The evaluation method is based on the association of {DPs} with expression changes in the same cellular conditions. Our empirical study based on several {ChIP}-seq experiments from transcription factors, histone modifications and simulated data shows that {ODIN} outperforms considered competing methods in most scenarios. \copyright The Author 2014.

There are few computational methods comparing changes in {ChIP}-seq signals with replicates. Moreover, none of these previous approaches addresses {ChIP}-seq specific experimental artefacts arising from studies with biological replicates. We propose {THOR}, a Hidden Markov Model based approach, to detect differential peaks between pairs of biological conditions with replicates. {THOR} provides all pre- and post-processing steps required in {ChIP}-seq analyses. Moreover, we propose a novel normalization approach based on housekeeping genes to deal with cases where replicates have distinct signal-to-noise ratios. To evaluate differential peak calling methods, we delineate a methodology using both biological and simulated data. This includes an evaluation procedure that associates differential peaks with changes in gene expression as well as histone modifications close to these peaks. We evaluate {THOR} and seven competing methods on data sets with distinct characteristics from in vitro studies with technical replicates to clinical studies of cancer patients. Our evaluation analysis comprises of 13 comparisons between pairs of biological conditions. We show that {THOR} performs best in all scenarios. \copyright The Author(s) 2016.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Chip-seq experiments are becoming a standard approach for genome-wide profiling protein-{DNA} interactions, such as detecting transcription factor binding sites, histone modification marks and {RNA} Polymerase {II} occupancy. However, when comparing a {ChIP} sample versus a control sample, such as Input {DNA}, normalization procedures have to be applied in order to remove experimental source of biases. Despite the substantial impact that the choice of the normalization method can have on the results of a {ChIP}-seq data analysis, their assessment is not fully explored in the literature. In particular, there are no diagnostic tools that show whether the applied normalization is indeed appropriate for the data being analyzed. {RESULTS}: In this work we propose a novel diagnostic tool to examine the appropriateness of the estimated normalization procedure. By plotting the empirical densities of log relative risks in bins of equal read count, along with the estimated normalization constant, after logarithmic transformation, the researcher is able to assess the appropriateness of the estimated normalization constant. We use the diagnostic plot to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates obtained by {CisGenome}, {NCIS} and {CCAT} on several real data examples. Moreover, we show the impact that the choice of the normalization constant can have on standard tools for peak calling such as {MACS} or {SICER}. Finally, we propose a novel procedure for controlling the {FDR} using sample swapping. This procedure makes use of the estimated normalization constant in order to gain power over the naive choice of constant (used in {MACS} and {SICER}), which is the ratio of the total number of reads in the {ChIP} and Input samples. {CONCLUSIONS}: Linear normalization approaches aim to estimate a scale factor, r, to adjust for different sequencing depths when comparing {ChIP} versus Input samples. The estimated scaling factor can easily be incorporated in many peak caller algorithms to improve the accuracy of the peak identification. The diagnostic plot proposed in this paper can be used to assess how adequate {ChIP}/Input normalization constants are, and thus it allows the user to choose the most adequate estimate for the analysis.}

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. {RESULTS}: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The advent of next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use {NGS} data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application. {RESULTS}: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates {NGS} runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, {BWA}, mr- and {mrsFAST}, Novoalign, {SHRiMP} and {SOAPv2}, with regard to accuracy and runtime. {CONCLUSION}: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively.

abstract = {Power-law distributions are the main functional form for the distribution of repeat size and repeat copy number in the human genome. When the genome is broken into fragments for sequencing, the limited size of fragments and reads may prevent an unique alignment of repeat sequences to the reference sequence. Repeats in the human genome can be as long as 10(4) bases, or 10(5) - 10(6) bases when allowing for mismatches between repeat units. Sequence reads from these regions are therefore unmappable when the read length is in the range of 10(3) bases. With a read length of 1000 bases, slightly more than 1\% of the assembled genome, and slightly less than 1\% of the 1 kb reads, are unmappable, excluding the unassembled portion of the human genome (8\% in {GRCh37}/hg19). The slow decay (long tail) of the power-law function implies a diminishing return in converting unmappable regions/reads to become mappable with the increase of the read length, with the understanding that increasing read length will always move toward the direction of 100\% mappability.}

However, the complexity of analyzing diverse patterns of {ChIP}-Seq signals, especially for epigenetic marks, still calls for the development of new algorithms and objective comparisons of existing methods. We developed Qeseq, an algorithm to detect regions of increased {ChIP} read density relative to background. Qeseq employs critical novel elements, such as iterative recalibration and neighbor joining of reads to identify enriched regions of any length. To objectively assess its performance relative to other 14 {ChIP}-Seq peak finders, we designed a novel protocol based on Validation Discriminant Analysis ({VDA}) to optimally select validation sites and generated two validation datasets, which are the most comprehensive to date for algorithmic benchmarking of key epigenetic marks. In addition, we systematically explored a total of 315 diverse parameter configurations from these algorithms and found that typically optimal parameters in one dataset do not generalize to other datasets. Nevertheless, default parameters show the most stable performance, suggesting that they should be used. This study also provides a reproducible and generalizable methodology for unbiased comparative analysis of high-throughput sequencing tools that can facilitate future algorithmic development.}

This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation ({DNA}-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the {GC} bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the {GC} content of the full {DNA} fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This {GC} effect is unimodal: both {GC}-rich fragments and {AT}-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that {PCR} is the most important cause of the {GC} bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific {GC}-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These {GC} modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as {ChIP}-seq and {RNA}-seq.}

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}) is the gold-standard technique for localizing nuclear proteins in the genome. We used {ChIP}, in combination with deep sequencing (Seq), to study the genome-wide distribution of the Silent information regulator (Sir) complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We analyzed {ChIP}-Seq peaks of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 silencing proteins and discovered 238 unexpected euchromatic loci that exhibited enrichment of all three. Surprisingly, published {ChIP}-Seq datasets for the Ste12 transcription factor and the centromeric Cse4 protein indicated that these proteins were also enriched in the same euchromatic regions with the high Sir protein levels. The 238 loci, termed "hyper-{ChIPable}", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase {II} and polymerase {III} enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and {ChIP} enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide. The apparent enrichment of various proteins at hyper-{ChIPable} loci was not a consequence of artifacts associated with deep sequencing methods, as confirmed by {ChIP}-quantitative {PCR}. The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations. {ChIP}-Seq on chromatin immunoprecipitated with a nuclear-localized {GFP} reproduced the above enrichment in an expression-dependent manner: induction of the {GAL} genes resulted in an increased {ChIP} signal of the {GFP} protein at these loci, with presumably no biological relevance. Whereas {ChIP} is a broadly valuable technique, some published conclusions based upon {ChIP} procedures may merit reevaluation in light of these findings.}

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) is widely used to detect genome-wide interactions between a protein of interest and {DNA} in vivo. Loci showing strong enrichment over adjacent background regions are typically considered to be sites of binding. Insufficient attention has been given to systematic artifacts inherent to the {ChIP}-seq procedure that might generate a misleading picture of protein binding to certain loci. We show here that unrelated transcription factors appear to consistently bind to the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes in yeast. Strikingly, several types of negative control experiments, including a protein that is not expected to bind chromatin, also showed similar patterns of strong binding within gene bodies. These false positive signals were evident across sequencing platforms and immunoprecipitation protocols, as well as in previously published datasets from other labs. We show that these false positive signals derive from high rates of transcription, and are inherent to the {ChIP} procedure, although they are exacerbated by sequencing library construction procedures. This expression bias is strong enough that a known transcriptional repressor like Tup1 can erroneously appear to be an activator. Another type of background bias stems from the inherent nucleosomal structure of chromatin, and can potentially make it seem like certain factors bind nucleosomes even when they don't. Our analysis suggests that a mock {ChIP} sample offers a better normalization control for the expression bias, whereas the {ChIP} input is more appropriate for the nucleosomal periodicity bias. While these controls alleviate the effect of the biases to some extent, they are unable to eliminate it completely. Caution is therefore warranted regarding the interpretation of data that seemingly show the association of various transcription and chromatin factors with highly transcribed genes in yeast.}

We propose to define sufficient sequencing depth as the number of reads at which detected enrichment regions increase \textless 1\% for an additional million reads. Although the required depth depends on the nature of the mark and the state of the cell in each experiment, we observe that sufficient depth is often reached at \textless 20 million reads for fly. For human, there are no clear saturation points for the examined datasets, but our analysis suggests 40-50 million reads as a practical minimum for most marks. We also devise a mathematical model to estimate the sufficient depth and total genomic coverage of a mark. Lastly, we find that the five algorithms tested do not agree well for broad enrichment profiles, especially at lower depths. Our findings suggest that sufficient sequencing depth and an appropriate peak-calling algorithm are essential for ensuring robustness of conclusions derived from {ChIP}-seq data. \copyright The Author(s) 2014.

Thus far, efforts to improve antibody reagents for {ChIP}-seq experiments have focused mainly on generating higher quality antibodies.

In addition to allowing the determination of occupancy sites within one cell type and under one condition, this method allows, in principle, the establishment and comparison of occupancy maps in various cell types, tissues, and conditions. Such comparisons require, however, that samples be normalized. Widely used normalization methods that include a quantile normalization step perform well when factor occupancy varies at a subset of sites, but may miss uniform genome-wide increases or decreases in site occupancy. We describe a spike adjustment procedure ({SAP}) that, unlike commonly used normalization methods intervening at the analysis stage, entails an experimental step prior to immunoprecipitation. A constant, low amount from a single batch of chromatin of a foreign genome is added to the experimental chromatin. This "spike" chromatin then serves as an internal control to which the experimental signals can be adjusted. We show that the method improves similarity between replicates and reveals biological differences including global and largely uniform changes. \copyright 2014 Bonhoure et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected. This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias. Paired-end sequencing revealed that single-end data underestimated {ChIP}-library complexity at high coverage. Removal of reads originating at the same base reduced false-positives but had little effect on detection sensitivity. Even at mappable-genome coverage depth of ∼1 read per base pair, ∼1\% of the narrow peaks detected on a tiling array were missed by {ChIP}-seq.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}) coupled with high-throughput sequencing ({ChIP}-Seq) is increasingly being used to map epigenetic states across genomes of diverse species. Chromatin modification profiles are frequently noisy and diffuse, spanning regions ranging from several nucleosomes to large domains of multiple genes. Much of the early work on the identification of {ChIP}-enriched regions for {ChIP}-Seq data has focused on identifying localized regions, such as transcription factor binding sites. Bioinformatic tools to identify diffuse domains of {ChIP}-enriched regions have been lacking. {RESULTS}: Based on the biological observation that histone modifications tend to cluster to form domains, we present a method that identifies spatial clusters of signals unlikely to appear by chance. This method pools together enrichment information from neighboring nucleosomes to increase sensitivity and specificity. By using genomic-scale analysis, as well as the examination of loci with validated epigenetic states, we demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in the identification of {ChIP}-enriched signals for histone modification profiles. We demonstrate the application of this unbiased method in important issues in {ChIP}-Seq data analysis, such as data normalization for quantitative comparison of levels of epigenetic modifications across cell types and growth conditions. {AVAILABILITY}: http://home.gwu.edu/ approximately wpeng/Software.htm. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

However, since {PolII} enriched regions in the genome can be very long, existing peak finding algorithms for {ChIP}-seq data are not adequate for identifying such long regions. {METHODS}: Here we propose an enriched region detection method for {ChIP}-seq data to identify long enriched regions by combining a signal denoising algorithm with a false discovery rate ({FDR}) approach. The binned {ChIP}-seq data for {PolII} are first processed using a non-local means ({NL}-means) algorithm for purposes of denoising. Then, a {FDR} approach is developed to determine the threshold for marking enriched regions in the binned histogram. {RESULTS}: We first test our method using a public {PolII} {ChIP}-seq dataset and compare our results with published results obtained using the published algorithm {HPeak}. Our results show a high consistency with the published results (80-100\%). Then, we apply our proposed method on {PolII} {ChIP}-seq data generated in our own study on the effects of hormone on the breast cancer cell line {MCF7}. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively identify long enriched regions in {ChIP}-seq datasets. Specifically, pertaining to {MCF7} control samples we identified 5,911 segments with length of at least 4 Kbp (maximum 233,000 bp); and in {MCF7} treated with E2 samples, we identified 6,200 such segments (maximum 325,000 bp). {CONCLUSIONS}: We demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in studying binding patterns of {PolII} in cancer cells which enables further deep analysis in transcription regulation and epigenetics. Our method complements existing peak detection algorithms for {ChIP}-seq experiments.}

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ({ChIP}-seq), a major application of {NGS}, is a widely adopted technique for examining protein-{DNA} interactions and is commonly used to investigate epigenetic signatures of diffuse histone marks. These datasets have notoriously high variance and subtle levels of enrichment across large expanses, making them exceedingly difficult to define. Windows-based, heuristic models and finite-state hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) have been used with some success in analyzing {ChIP}-seq data but with lingering limitations. To improve the ability to detect broad regions of enrichment, we developed a stochastic Bayesian Change-Point ({BCP}) method, which addresses some of these unresolved issues. {BCP} makes use of recent advances in infinite-state {HMMs} by obtaining explicit formulas for posterior means of read densities. These posterior means can be used to categorize the genome into enriched and unenriched segments, as is customarily done, or examined for more detailed relationships since the underlying subpeaks are preserved rather than simplified into a binary classification. {BCP} performs a near exhaustive search of all possible change points between different posterior means at high-resolution to minimize the subjectivity of window sizes and is computationally efficient, due to a speed-up algorithm and the explicit formulas it employs. In the absence of a well-established "gold standard" for diffuse histone mark enrichment, we corroborated {BCP}'s island detection accuracy and reproducibility using various forms of empirical evidence. We show that {BCP} is especially suited for analysis of diffuse histone {ChIP}-seq data but also effective in analyzing punctate transcription factor {ChIP} datasets, making it widely applicable for numerous experiment types.}

abstract = {Computational methods to identify functional genomic elements using genetic information have been very successful in determining gene structure and in identifying a handful of cis-regulatory elements. But the vast majority of regulatory elements have yet to be discovered, and it has become increasingly apparent that their discovery will not come from using genetic information alone. Recently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the creation of information-rich epigenetic maps, most notably for histone modifications. However, tools that search for functional elements using this epigenetic information have been lacking. Here, we describe an unsupervised learning method called {ChromaSig} to find, in an unbiased fashion, commonly occurring chromatin signatures in both tiling microarray and sequencing data. Applying this algorithm to nine chromatin marks across a 1\% sampling of the human genome in {HeLa} cells, we recover eight clusters of distinct chromatin signatures, five of which correspond to known patterns associated with transcriptional promoters and enhancers. Interestingly, we observe that the distinct chromatin signatures found at enhancers mark distinct functional classes of enhancers in terms of transcription factor and coactivator binding. In addition, we identify three clusters of novel chromatin signatures that contain evolutionarily conserved sequences and potential cis-regulatory elements. Applying {ChromaSig} to a panel of 21 chromatin marks mapped genomewide by {ChIP}-Seq reveals 16 classes of genomic elements marked by distinct chromatin signatures. Interestingly, four classes containing enrichment for repressive histone modifications appear to be locally heterochromatic sites and are enriched in quickly evolving regions of the genome. The utility of this approach in uncovering novel, functionally significant genomic elements will aid future efforts of genome annotation via chromatin modifications.}

Identification of protein binding sites from {ChIP}-seq data has required novel computational tools, distinct from those used for the analysis of {ChIP}-Chip experiments. The growing popularity of {ChIP}-seq spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage. Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for {ChIP}-seq analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability. Our analysis provides an unbiased critical assessment of available technologies, and should assist researchers in choosing a suitable tool for handling {ChIP}-seq data.}

To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.}

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}) followed by high throughput sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) is rapidly becoming the method of choice for discovering cell-specific transcription factor binding locations genome wide. By aligning sequenced tags to the genome, binding locations appear as peaks in the tag profile. Several programs have been designed to identify such peaks, but program evaluation has been difficult due to the lack of benchmark data sets. We have created benchmark data sets for three transcription factors by manually evaluating a selection of potential binding regions that cover typical variation in peak size and appearance. Performance of five programs on this benchmark showed, first, that external control or background data was essential to limit the number of false positive peaks from the programs. However, \textgreater80\% of these peaks could be manually filtered out by visual inspection alone, without using additional background data, showing that peak shape information is not fully exploited in the evaluated programs. Second, none of the programs returned peak-regions that corresponded to the actual resolution in {ChIP}-seq data. Our results showed that {ChIP}-seq peaks should be narrowed down to 100-400 bp, which is sufficient to identify unique peaks and binding sites. Based on these results, we propose a meta-approach that gives improved peak definitions.}

The state of the art for analyzing {ChIP}-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome (uni-reads). This can lead to the omission of up to 30\% of alignable reads. We describe a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads). Our approach is based on allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human {STAT1} and mouse {GATA1} {ChIP}-seq datasets, we illustrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads, and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions. We investigate various genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected only by utilization of multi-reads via computational experiments. Overall, peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. We further validate a number of {GATA1} multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time {ChIP} analysis and identify novel target genes of {GATA1}. These computational and experimental results establish that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with {ChIP}-seq experiments.}

However, two questions remain to be answered: (i) to which extent is a {ChIP}-seq experiment able to reveal the weak {ChIP}-enriched sites? (ii) are the weak sites biologically meaningful? To answer these questions, it is necessary to identify the weak {ChIP} signals from background noise. {RESULTS}: We propose a linear signal-noise model, in which a noise rate was introduced to represent the fraction of noise in a {ChIP} library. We developed an iterative algorithm to estimate the noise rate using a control library, and derived a library-swapping strategy for the false discovery rate estimation. These approaches were integrated in a general-purpose framework, named {CCAT} (Control-based {ChIP}-seq Analysis Tool), for the significance analysis of {ChIP}-seq. Applications to {H3K4me3} and {H3K36me3} datasets showed that {CCAT} predicted significantly more {ChIP}-enriched sites that the previous methods did. With the high sensitivity of {CCAT} prediction, we revealed distinct chromatin features associated to the strong and weak {H3K4me3} sites. {AVAILABILITY}: http://cmb.gis.a-star.edu.sg/{ChIPSeq}/tools.htm.}

We mined the resulting {SOM} to identify chromatin signatures related to sequence-specific transcription factor occupancy, sequence motif enrichment, and biological functions. To highlight clusters enriched for specific functions such as transcriptional promoters or enhancers, we overlaid onto the map additional data sets not used during training, such as {ChIP}-seq, {RNA}-seq, {CAGE}, and information on cis-acting regulatory modules from the literature. We used the {SOM} to parse known transcriptional enhancers according to the cell-type-specific chromatin signature, and we further corroborated this pattern on the map by {EP300} (also known as p300) occupancy. New candidate cell-type-specific enhancers were identified for multiple {ENCODE} cell types in this way, along with new candidates for ubiquitous enhancer activity. An interactive web interface was developed to allow users to visualize and custom-mine the {ENCODE} {SOM}.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Although many next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. {RESULTS}: The value of {NGS} read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Trimmomatic is licensed under {GPL} V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic {CONTACT}: usadel@bio1.rwth-aachen.de {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author 2014.

abstract = {Quantitative and systems biology approaches benefit from the unprecedented depth of next-generation sequencing. A typical experiment yields millions of short reads, which oftentimes carry particular sequence tags. These tags may be: (a) specific to the sequencing platform and library construction method (e.g., adapter sequences); (b) have been introduced by experimental design (e.g., sample barcodes); or (c) constitute some biological signal (e.g., splice leader sequences in nematodes). Our software {FLEXBAR} enables accurate recognition, sorting and trimming of sequence tags with maximal flexibility, based on exact overlap sequence alignment. The software supports data formats from all current sequencing platforms, including color-space reads. {FLEXBAR} maintains read pairings and processes separate barcode reads on demand. Our software facilitates the fine-grained adjustment of sequence tag detection parameters and search regions. {FLEXBAR} is a multi-threaded software and combines speed with precision. Even complex read processing scenarios might be executed with a single command line call. We demonstrate the utility of the software in terms of read mapping applications, library demultiplexing and splice leader detection. {FLEXBAR} and additional information is available for academic use from the website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexbar/.}
